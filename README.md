## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic to streamline how AI systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), connect to and interact with external data sources and tools. It’s designed to solve a key limitation of AI models: their isolation from real-time, dynamic data. Instead of relying solely on static training data or requiring custom integrations for every new data source, MCP provides a universal, standardized way for AI applications to access and use information from various systems—like databases, APIs, file systems, or business tools—securely and efficiently.

Think of MCP as a "USB-C for AI integrations." Just as a USB-C port allows different devices to connect to a computer using one standard, MCP enables AI models to plug into diverse data sources and tools through a single protocol. This reduces the complexity of building and maintaining separate connections, making AI systems more flexible, scalable, and context-aware. For example, an AI assistant using MCP could check your calendar, fetch files from Google Drive, or query a database, all without needing bespoke code for each task.

MCP operates on a client-server architecture:
- **MCP Hosts**: These are the AI applications (like a chatbot or an IDE plugin) that need access to external data or capabilities.
- **MCP Clients**: These sit within the host and manage secure, one-to-one connections to servers.
- **MCP Servers**: These are lightweight programs that expose specific tools, data, or resources (e.g., a GitHub server might provide repository access) to the AI.

### MCP Architecture

MCP uses a **Host → Client → Server** architecture:

```
┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│   MCP Host      │    │   MCP Client    │    │   MCP Server    │
│                 │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • LLM App       │◄──►│ • Manages conn. │◄──►│ • Exposes tools │
│ • Claude        │    │ • Handles auth  │    │ • Provides data │  
│ • ChatGPT       │    │ • Security      │    │ • Resources     │
│ • OpenAI Agents │    │                 │    │                 │
│ • Custom AI     │    │                 │    │                 │
└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

The protocol uses JSON-RPC 2.0 for communication, allowing dynamic, two-way interactions—such as fetching real-time data or executing actions—while incorporating security features like access controls. It also supports dynamic tool discovery, meaning the AI can figure out what tools or data are available without hard-coded knowledge.

In practice, MCP empowers AI to be more than just a text generator—it can act as an agent that interacts with the world. Developers benefit from reduced integration overhead, and the open-source nature of MCP fosters a growing ecosystem of reusable servers for platforms like Slack, GitHub, or even local file systems. It’s a step toward making AI more practical and connected in real-world applications.

### The Context
This serverless capability, combined with the OAuth 2.1 authentication, streamable HTTP transport, JSON-RPC, and tool annotations, makes the MCP update a holistic leap forward. It’s clear the spec is evolving to support a wider range of deployment models—persistent servers for heavy, consistent workloads and serverless for lightweight, on-demand tasks. This duality strengthens MCP’s position as a versatile standard, catering to both resource-intensive enterprise needs and lean, agile projects.

The serverless shift also reinforces MCP’s ethos of reducing friction: just as it aims to standardize AI-tool integration, it now minimizes the operational overhead of running those integrations. Expect this to fuel a wave of experimentation, with developers potentially releasing serverless MCP servers as open-source templates, further enriching the ecosystem. 

### Broader Context and Future Outlook
These updates, reflect MCP’s rapid evolution since its introduction by Anthropic in November 2024. They address practical challenges identified by early adopters—like Block, Zed, and Sourcegraph—while aligning with the protocol’s promise of a “USB-C-like” standard for AI integrations. The shift to streamable HTTP and batching suggests a focus on real-time, high-throughput use cases, while OAuth 2.1 signals a maturing security framework. Together, these changes position MCP as a more robust and versatile protocol, capable of supporting sophisticated, context-aware AI agents that seamlessly interact with diverse tools and data sources.

Looking ahead, the implications point to a growing ecosystem where MCP could become a default standard for AI-tool integration, reducing reliance on fragmented, vendor-specific solutions. However, challenges remain—such as ensuring broad adoption and refining the spec further (e.g., finalizing webhooks or event-driven features)—but these updates mark a significant step toward making AI systems more connected, efficient, and accessible.

## OpenAI Adoption of MCP

On March 25, 2025, OpenAI announced that it is adopting the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** across all its products, with the **Agents SDK** already shipping with this feature and other products set to follow soon. This move has significant implications for developers, enterprises, and the broader AI ecosystem. Below, We’ll break down what this means and why it matters.
